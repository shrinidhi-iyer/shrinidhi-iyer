- 💻 Writes code that works... eventually.  
- 🧩 Solves bugs like Sherlock – but with more console logs.  
- 📚 Actually *reads* the docs. Like, willingly.  
- 🐾 Cat-level focus when coding — minus the naps.  
- ☕ 98% curious, 2% panicking when the code doesn’t work — but still learning, not copying 😉
